# Technical Report: Implementation and Analysis of Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows

## Executive Summary
This report analyzes the implementation of a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) solution that combines multiple algorithmic approaches including Dijkstra's algorithm, greedy construction, dynamic programming, and backtracking. The implementation provides a practical solution for optimizing delivery routes while respecting time constraints and vehicle capacities.

## 1. Problem Definition

### 1.1 Overview
The Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows addresses the challenge of optimizing delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles while adhering to:
- Customer time window constraints
- Vehicle capacity limitations
- Service time requirements
- Depot return requirements

### 1.2 Key Constraints
- Each customer must be served within their specified time window
- Vehicle capacity cannot be exceeded
- All routes must start and end at the depot
- Each customer must be served exactly once
- Service times must be respected

## 2. Implementation Architecture

### 2.1 Data Structures

#### 2.1.1 Time Window Structure
```c
typedef struct {
    int earliest;    // Earliest allowed service time
    int latest;      // Latest allowed service time
    int service_time;// Duration of service
} TimeWindow;
```

#### 2.1.2 Customer Structure
```c
typedef struct {
    int x, y;              // Location coordinates
    TimeWindow time_window;
    bool is_served;
    int demand;            // Customer demand
} Customer;
```

#### 2.1.3 Vehicle Structure
```c
typedef struct {
    int capacity;
    int current_load;
    int current_time;
    int current_location;
    int *route;
    int route_size;
} Vehicle;
